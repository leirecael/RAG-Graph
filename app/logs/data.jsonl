[problem]\n- **complexity in managing large Feature Models(complexity; understanding; inconsistencies; integration challenge; awareness)**: The challenge of managing and understanding the constraints and relations among a large number of features in Software Product Lines, which can lead to potential invalid derived products.; The challenge of not fully comprehending the characteristics and implications of feature cohesion within software product lines, which is crucial for variability and reuse.; The challenge of maintaining consistency between feature models and the code implementing them due to complex dependencies and frequent feature evolution.; The challenge of maintaining large feature models due to their complexity and the presence of numerous cross-tree constraints, which make them difficult to understand and manage.; The challenge of bridging the gap between product line features and product line architecture (PLA), where features and PLA are usually defined in separate models and developed using different tools, leading to inconsistencies and manual overhead.; The challenge of managing and tracking changes at the feature level in software product lines, which is commonly lacking despite frequent updates and extensions. [problem]\n- **effort-intensive scoping process(scoping process)**: The scoping process in Software Product Lines Engineering is effort-intensive, requiring significant time investment in workshops and interviews with domain experts. [problem]\n- **excessive coordination overhead in SPLs(coordination issues)**: The challenge of managing and reducing the coordination overhead that arises from the need to integrate long-living branches back into the master branch in Software Product Lines (SPLs), which can lead to 'integration hell' due to the complexity and volume of code changes. [problem]\n- **inability to analyze code-level reuse potential(reuse potential analysis)**: The challenge of not being able to reliably estimate the code-level similarity of product variants, which can delay or prevent the extractive SPL adoption. [problem]\n- **inadequate assessment of modularity, detection of interferences, and analysis of trade-offs(inadequate assessment)**: The traditional methods for characterizing software product line requirements using either functional or quality criteria are inadequate for assessing modularity, detecting interferences, and analyzing trade-offs. [problem]\n- **inadequate feature location identification(feature management)**: The challenge of identifying and locating features within software systems, which is often a daunting and error-prone task, especially when feature locations are scattered across the codebase. [problem]\n- **inadequate handling of complex dependencies in variability management(variability management issues)**: Existing software variability modeling approaches and tools are inadequate to handle variability management issues, particularly complex dependencies. [problem]\n- **inadequate measurement of similarity between product-line variants(measurement challenge)**: The challenge of accurately measuring similarity between product-line variants using only high-level abstraction information, which may not reflect the actual similarity due to varying impacts of features.
